# Holographic
Sketches to create holgraphic views.

## hologram
Arduino sketch to create a hologram on a TFT 2.4" display.
Includes four sample images to view with a holograph.

The sketch uses the MCUFriend library to handle the display.
See links inside the sketch to get use own images.

## holograph
The holograph I use is based on the one built in this article for mobile phones with a 4.7".

To build my projector see the Freecad design files.
I scaled the mobile phone projector to fit the TFT 2.4" display.

Enjoy!
